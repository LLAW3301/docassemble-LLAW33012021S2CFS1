question: Clearance of Vegetation
subquestion: |
  Keeping your home and property well managed throughout the year 
  is essential to bushfire safety. There are different ways to ensure 
  you manage your property for the bushfire season, including clearing 
  of vegetation, management of dwellings, and clearance of flammable 
  and excess items around the home.

  Reducing the amount of vegetation on a property is one of the most 
  critical components of preparing for bushfires. However, there are 
  council and statute requirements around the clearing of private land 
  that depend on the size of the land, and whether you can simply clear 
  the vegetation or whether it needs to be burned off.

  There a number of tasks that can be completed without the approval of the
  council or Country Fire Service, including:
  
  * Removal of all leaves, dead branches or vegetation on the ground
  
  * Ensuring all gutters are cleared
  
  * Slashing/mowing of paddocks with as much green waste removed as possible 
  
  * Removal of rubbish away from the home or structures 
  
  * Wood piles are stored away from the home
  
  * Prune tree limbs that are lower than two metres above the ground,
  or overhanging our home

  Importantly, regulations allow you to self-manage vegetation that 
  is within 20 metres of your home, or 5 metres of sheds and garages 
  without a permit.

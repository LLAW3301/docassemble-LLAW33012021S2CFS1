question: Clear Vegetation to Prepare for Fires
subquestion:  |

  If you want to clear vegetation as part of preparing your property for a fire,
  you do not need to get approval from the Native Vegetation Council or the Country
  Fire Service (except for large trees within 20m of a dwelling).
    
  All you need to do is:
  
  * *Self-assess* that you are clearing vegetation for the purposes of fire prevention.
  
  * *Consider* if there are other practical alternatives to clearing such as trenching that has a width of no more than 5 metres.
  If you are not the landowner, obtain the written permission of the landowner.
  
  * *Clear vegetation* in accordance with any applicable bushfire management plan or another plan for the management of bushfires.
  **(Note: You cannot clear large trees with a trunk circumference greater than 2 meters)**
  
  If your proposed clearance does not meet the requirements described, you can submit a clearance application under Section 28 of the Native Vegetation Act 1991 which can be done [here](${ url_of('https://www.environment.sa.gov.au/topics/native-vegetation/clearing/clearance-applications') }).

question: Permit Information
subquestion:  |
  ###When to Obtain a Permit

  Permits are required to light a fire, burn off, or operate spark-creating equipment or machinery during the fire-ban season. During the fire ban season, a schedule 9 permit must be applied for. To complete any of the above activities on a complete fire ban day, a schedule 10 permit must be applied for. If a permit is not applied for and granted, and you perform any of the above activities during the fire ban season or on a complete fire ban day, penalties of up to $10,000 and two years of jail or on the spot fines of $315 can be issued.
  
  ####How to Apply for a schedule 9 or 10 Permit

  * Permits are free of charge and can be requested by telephone, fax or email from most local councils.
  * Permit applications may be refused by the Authorised Officer if the activity is deemed too risky.
  * An Authorised Officer will assess your application and, if granted, give you a permit number and the specific conditions that apply to your permit.

question: Clear Vegetation to Prepare for Fires
subquestion:  |

  If you want to clear vegetation as part of preparing your property for
  a fire, you do not need to get approval from the Native Vegetation
  Council or the Country Fire Service (except for large trees within
  20m of a dwelling).
    
  All you need to do is:
  
  * *Self-assess* that you are clearing vegetation for the
  purposes of fire prevention.
  
  * *Consider* if there are other practical alternatives to
  clearing such as trenching that has a width of no more than
  5 metres. If you are not the landowner, obtain the written
  permission of the landowner.
  
  * *Clear vegetation* in accordance with any applicable
  bushfire management plan or another plan for the management
  of bushfires. *(Caution: You cannot clear large trees with a
  trunk circumference greater than 2 meters)*
  
  If your proposed clearance does not meet the requirements
  described, you can submit a clearance application under
  Section 28 of the Native Vegetation Act 1991 which can be
  done [here](${ url_of('https://www.environment.sa.gov.au/topics/native-vegetation/clearing/clearance-applications') }).

question: Permit Information
subquestion:  |
  ###When to Obtain a Permit

  Permits are required to light a fire, burn off, or operate
  spark-creating equipment or machinery during the fire-ban season.
  During the fire ban season, a schedule 9 permit must be applied for.
  To complete any of the above activities on a complete fire ban day,
  a schedule 10 permit must be applied for. If a permit is not applied
  for and granted, and you perform any of the above activities during
  the fire ban season or on a complete fire ban day, penalties of up
  to $10,000 and two years of jail or on the spot fines of $315 can be issued.
  
  ####How to Apply for a schedule 9 or 10 Permit

  * Permits are free of charge and can be requested by telephone,
  fax or email from most local councils.
  
  * Permit applications may be refused by the Authorised Officer if the
  activity is deemed too risky.
  
  * An Authorised Officer will assess your application and, if granted,
  give you a permit number and the  specific conditions that apply to
  your permit.

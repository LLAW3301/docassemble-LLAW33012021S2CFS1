#information on neighbouring properties
event: endpoint['neighbouringPropertiesFinal']
question: Information on Neighbouring Properties
subquestion:  |
  
  ####Legal Responsibilities

  It is important to remove any vegetation, dead branches, leaves and 
  undergrowth away from your home. There may be neighbouring properties 
  that have been neglected to be bushfire ready.
  
  Ensuring that the land is maintained will allow for easier access to 
  firefighters if there is a fire. It may also give you greater protection 
  if a fire is threatening you. 

  What to do first:

  * Knock on the neighbours door for a chat about your concerns
  
  * Installing a stone wall or earth barrier between the two properties
  
  * Dropping a letter in the neighbours letterbox
  (or front door if there is no letterbox)

  If you can not contact the neighbouring property owner,
  we suggest the below:

  * Contact the council for the owner's contact details.
  Some councils will provide this information, while others will not
  
  * Request the council to do a site visit, as a public safety hazard
  
  * Contact the CFS to arrange a site inspection of the neighbouring property
